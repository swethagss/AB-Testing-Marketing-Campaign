## Approach 
  - Conducted **data cleaning and exploratory analysis**
  - Calculated key metrics: **CTR, Conversion Rate, CPC, ROI**
  - Performed **AB testing / hypothesis testing** to compare campaigns

  - Visualized results with **Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)**

## Key Insights
  - **Facebook Ads**: Fewer clicks/views but higher conversion rate and more consistent high-conversion days
  - **AdWords**: Higher reach (views & clicks) but lower conversion rate and high variability
  - **Correlation Analysis:**
    - Facebook clicks vs conversions: r = 0.87 â†’ strong positive relationship
    - AdWords clicks vs conversions: r = 0.45 â†’ moderate positive relationship
  - **Trend Analysis:**
